# CSC-690-project
###Waleed Ghaleb (917565667) and Victor Callejas


In this final project, work devideed by both partner, Victor and Waleed, we decided on creating a AR (Augmented Reality) application to be able to view endangered animals. Its an attempt to bring awareness of wild life trafficking. This app will allow the users to view specific animals that are endangered and allowing the users to see the beauty and need of preserving these animals.
