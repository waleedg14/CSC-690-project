# CSC-690-project

In this final project my partner and I made an Augmented Reality application. This gives a variety of around globe Endangered Animals available for viewing in 3D. The ultimate goal of this mobile application is to raise awareness, to make the majority of the public be involved in the fight against wildlife trafficking.
